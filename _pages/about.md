I'm an AI engineer based in Amsterdam 🇳🇱, originally from [Curaçao 🇨🇼](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao).

Currently:
- building a platform for instructing and deploying tool-using LLMs at [Neena](https://neena.io/)
- learning about AI alignment and mechanistic interpretability 

I was previously a graduate researcher at Amazon, IBM, and [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) where I worked with [prof. dr. Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Sandro Pezzelle](https://sandropezzelle.github.io/).

I'm fascinated by intelligence, both its artificial and biological emergence.

I love music, writing, and languages (human and programming).
