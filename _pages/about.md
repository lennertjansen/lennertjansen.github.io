I'm an AI engineer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, originally from [Curaçao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao).

I'm currently working on LLM agency for tool-use at [Neena](https://neena.io/).

I was previously a graduate researcher at Amazon, IBM, and [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) where I worked with [prof. dr. Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Sandro Pezzelle](https://sandropezzelle.github.io/).

I'm fascinated by intelligence and both its artificial and biological emergence.

I love music, writing, and language learning.
