AI engineer based in Amsterdam 🇳🇱, originally from [Curaçao 🇨🇼](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao).

Fascinated by intelligence, both its artificial and biological emergence.

I love music, writing, and languages.

Currently:
- building [Neena](https://neena.io/)
- learning how to build interpreters and compilers
- learning about AI alignment and mechanistic interpretability 

Previously:
- researcher at IBM Amsterdam, Amazon Berlin where I worked with [Michael Brückner](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=5ZyZ9JwAAAAJ&hl=de), and [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) where I worked with [prof. dr. Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Sandro Pezzelle](https://sandropezzelle.github.io/)
